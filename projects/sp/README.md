## Introduction

***Semestral project in BPC-DE2: Communication with GPS module***  
  
Authors:  
 - Radek Theumer  
 - Jindrich Zabka  
 - Jonas Hubacek


## Hardware

- AVR ATmega2560, 8-bit controller
- PA6H GPS module
- Nokia5110 LCD display

> We use ATmega2560 kit, because this controller provides four USARTs. To communication with PC we use USART0 (connect with USB port usbACK0) and to receive data from GPS we use USART1.


## Software development

Creating application:  
- [x] LCD Nokia5110 running (28th Nov)  
- [x] USAT0 and USART1 communication with GPS module and PC running (5th Dec)  
- [ ] assignment receive data into arrays  
- [ ] test of GPS outside
